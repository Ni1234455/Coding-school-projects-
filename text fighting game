#Combat system
Turn-based combat;
At the beginning of every turn, the user will choose between Attacking, Using a Skill, or Defending
  Attacking is a simple attack; damage calculated:
  receiver's new HP = receiver's [(DEF * 1.25) (if defending) or DEF (if any other action)] - user's ATK
  Skills; From a set list to be enumerated soon. Costs MP to accomplish a variety of facts; MGK and MGKDef account for the damage calculation
  Def: Boosts DEF and MGKDEF by 1.25x at the cost of an action

Once actions are selected by both parties, SPD determines who moves first; the entity with the highest speed  moves first, and the entity with the lowest speed moves last

Immediately once an entire party's HP is depleted,that side is declared to have lost, and the other side is declared to have won.
